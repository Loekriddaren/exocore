title: Hednisk anime

Reminder that anime is the only modern artform acting within an unbroken pagan tradition, created by a people with a pagan mindset.

"Pagans" who disregard anime as degenerate are just protestants with another set of books.

I wish European pagans could stop producing cope and seethe over a Tradition that was broken a thousand years ago, and just create beautiful and fun things instead. That we could wait with excitement for the gods to return, instead of acting like puritans over old fragments.
