Historical accuracy is just another form of fantasy. For our peoples have no real, living connection to these lost ages. Much better to just create something that is enjoyable – to let your blood speak with images that resonate with your actual people. To create a new dream.

Much of the radical right is just obsessed with purity. Everything must fit with some lost age, tradition or culture. To talk of EUROPE, while the real Europeans around you just shrug at your abstractions. Your people is not stupid, your dream is, as it can’t reach them.

Look at all these stupid things modern man enjoy. Then how much more stupid must not the Right be, if it can’t create anything exciting to catch his attention. The world is a struggle – but struggle is supposed to be fun. This sternness just kills inspiration in its cradle.

Heroism is an art rather than a duty – a feeling rather than a fact. You could know everything about the ancient world, but the favour of the gods is won in your own time – in the struggle around you. And if the ancient world matters no more, then why should I care?
