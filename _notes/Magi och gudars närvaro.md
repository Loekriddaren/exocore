title: Magi och gudars närvaro

Tradition is founded upon the presence of actual gods, and when gods are present, you will notice. Call it wonders or magic, but a living tradition can back up its claims – where a living god resides, where men follow on his path, there will be power, beauty and wonders.

Many claim to revive some long lost tradition, but if they have no wonder to show, you’ll know no actual god is present. Their work remains a human project, and there’s nothing wrong with that – but to call it Tradition is to claim godhood, and that is a terrible lie.

I do not mean that we shouldn’t seek knowledge from the past – the memory of Aryan tradition is after all the source of my own art. But my art is art, and nothing more. I do not pray with it, I do not pretend to revive the past – my art only longs, for the end of our cycle.

To believe oneself to be a part of old Aryan tradition is to miss the struggle of our own time. For our challenge is to face the end. Our challenge is to persevere in a land of no gods, to survive the coming culling – to stand victorious on our own feet, the day gods return.

There are many pagans out there reading old books, sacrificing mead, arguing on the internet – but the day our gods actually return, the day they walk the earth with human feet again, you will notice. Do not think that you are already home, that you already know the gods.

Your single mission is to preserve your own blood – in all its simplicity. Living by dead traditions only furthers you from the purity of struggle. Those of us who manage to build a future for our children in a godless world – to our descendents will the gods one day return.
