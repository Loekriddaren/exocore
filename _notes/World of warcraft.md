World of Warcraft (classic) is closer to God than anyone claiming to revive Tradition.

Tradition is when gods walk the earth, and The Dark Age is when no gods are present. To “revive” Tradition in our age is not only pretending, but pretending that one does not pretend.

World of Warcraft on the other hand is just pretending. It is completely sincere in pretending, aiming for nothing more than the beauty, excitement and coziness of human imagination. It is what it is – a myth without real gods – and it strives to fulfill itself as such.

Traditions die with their gods, and are born with the birth of new gods. Tradition is not mere human knowledge or faith, but a celestial battle, taking place on earth. To study and recreate the forms of a dead Tradition – of a lost battle – is too only a myth without gods.

Those who “revive” Traditions only partake in a human creation, without a god walking among them. And there’s nothing wrong with that – if one was sincere. Human creation is something wonderful, and the best we can do in our age – but to call it Tradition is a great lie.

In its sincerity and playfulness, World of Warcraft is a more noble experience than the tedious and all too serious recreation of dead ages. But it doesn’t have to be like this – through sincerely pretending, the heroism of an ancient past could get a new, human life.

Yes, not only should one proudly confess that one pretends, but be ready to die for this pretending. To make pretending more than just a game, to make the beauty of human imagination real with blood. Don’t be a scholar. Be a knight of absurdity, a myth waiting for new gods.

That’s the best we can do in our fallen age – to admit ourselves as fallen, yet bleed for the dream of gods returning. We can only imagine – with the joy of a child, yet the loyalty of a vassal who never left his post. Become a heroic poet, die for the joy of pretending.
