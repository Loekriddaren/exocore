title: Döda traditioner

I don’t like pagans who argue about a battle that was lost to Christianity a thousand years ago. An Aryan should know that the world is a cycle, and care about what is to come after Christ rather than what is dead. Broken traditions serve no purpose – but the gods will be reborn.
