title: Om intuition

Intuition is the highest form of knowledge, for it is based on who you are. Intuition is the memory of our first home, the blood of our first ancestor, the sky of our first dawn. And intuition is alive, a part of your own flesh – the past breathing as if no time had passed.

Furthermore, intuition is the greatest force of change. For intuition speaks directly to and from the blood of your kin. Intuition is immediate, it knows what has to be done. And it speaks with a tongue of our own time – it lives as much in the future as in the past.

History is only a tool, illustrating what intuition already knows. The blood of our ancestors already flows in our veins – what it once created it can create again. Intuition is the living voice and force of this blood, while history is the memory of previous iterations.

I aim to make my art a work of pure intuition. Everyone claiming to have a vision for our future should do so. For the ability of intuition is the presence of living truth. Without intuition there is no rebirth, nothing new manifesting the ancient – only empty abstractions.
