title: Till livmoderns riddare
---
Varg is based precisely because he just makes stuff up. Because he acts on a living impulse within, instead of dead books and barrows. He both embraces and overcomes the emptiness of modernity – a world the gods left – by turning his life into an RPG. But he lacks sincerity.

He feels the need to be a part of a broken Tradition. To pretend like he does not pretend. Instead of forging his own heroism in a world of ruins, he jarringly chains his imagination to the boulders of a lost battle, creating only a religion of cope and bad polemics.

He is truly gifted and powerful. One of those few who can create a whole new life and path out of nothing. If only he was sincere enough to walk this new path – becoming the first ancestor of a new tribe, instead of pretending as if he belongs to the dead tribes of the past.

It's far better to be a knight of the placenta than a neo-pagan. Varg’s spiritual connection with the placenta is something alive and real to him, a path forward for his blood, an impulse to create, struggle and die for. But he destroys it all by calling it pagan tradition.

Varg is the only European after the war who has created a new life. I want to be like Varg – but sincere where he could not. I will not call my art pagan or traditional – I will call it pretending. I will call it a dream or an impulse, and bleed for this silly game.
