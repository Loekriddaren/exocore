title: Om Guds son

Nothing can be greater than God's own sacrifice, but greater than God on the cross is the whole world as God's sacrifice. That this world is already holy, and that He bleeds with our struggle.

It is striking how Christ hangs upon an incomplete swastika. The cross represents the unmoved and eternal, but it is seperated from the sorrounding cycle. The eternal recurrence of the world is replaced by one man, and the holy earth is replaced by a longing for the next world.
